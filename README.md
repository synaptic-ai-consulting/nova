# NOVA - Work Crew Builder (WCB)

A **zero-code, drag-and-drop system** for Cursor IDE that lets any professional — regardless of technical skill — generate a custom team of AI agent personas tailored to their specific job.

## Overview

Work Crew Builder uses the **O*NET Generalized Work Activities Framework** (41 standardized work activities across 900+ US occupations) combined with best-in-class context engineering to help you build a crew of specialized AI agents. Install in minutes, no terminal or coding required.

3. **Follow** — Nova (your builder) will guide you through role analysis, task mapping, and crew generation
